# Bundler comes with a Capistrano task that will grab the locked
# gems specified in Gemfile.lock and put them in shared/bundle,
# skipping the gems defined in the development and test groups.
#
# More information available at:
#
#   https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/blob/master/lib/bundler/deployment.rb
# 
# Warning: this requires bundler to be installed. On the standard
# WebFaction setup, you should have bundler 1.0.10, which should
# be good enough.

# With WebFaction, we define an application, but this is
# actually a folder containing an nginx configuration folder,
# a gem folder and the actual application folder, which
# WebFaction calls "a site".
#
# The convention we'll use is that we define an application,
# e.g. "artaround", and have a site for staging and a site
# for production.
