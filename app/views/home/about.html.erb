  <p>ArtAround is a budding social project to map art in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Oakland, and around the country. It is a community and a non-profit organization.</p>

  <p>ArtAround is fiscally sponsored by the <a href=http://www.gaffta.org/>Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a> and funded in part by Converse.</p>

  <h4>Things we believe</h4>

  <p>We believe in freedom of expression and we believe in sharing. We share what we know as well as what we do, whether that means sharing the details about a piece of art or sharing a line of code.</p>

  <p>ArtAround aims to help people connect with the art around them, by building open-source, open-data applications, and by using existing platforms, such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.</p>

  <h4>Made in the Bay, Born in D.C.</h4>

  <p>ArtAroundâ€™s operations are headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, but it was born in Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p>The idea was the brainchild of Laurenellen McCann, a D.C. resident. She worked hand-in-hand with the <a href="http://dcarts.dc.gov/DC/DCARTS/">DC Commission for the Arts and Humanities</a> to make it a reality in 2010.</p>

  <p>Anna Bloom, now ArtAround's executive director, joined Laurenellen in 2011 to expand ArtAround beyond D.C. Anna previously worked with the cities of Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, and Philadelphia to build mobile websites that let people discover art in those cities.</p>
